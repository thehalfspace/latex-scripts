The rest of the fault is velocity strengthening region ($(a-b)>0$) and accommodates aseismic motion. The top 2 km of the fault is also prescribed to be velocity strengthening as suggested by certain observations. The effective normal stress is constant below the depth of 2km, since the increase in the lithostatic stress is accommodated by the pore fluid pressure at depth.
