\begin{itemize}
        \item The depth measurements are shallow, we can talk about induced seismicity but not about most faults?
        \item High permeability would imply what in terms of pore pressure?
        \item What is the relation between differential stress and fluid pressure?
        \item Characteristic length scale of faulting?
    \end{itemize}
